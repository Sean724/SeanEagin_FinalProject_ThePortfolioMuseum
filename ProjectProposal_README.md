# Features: I would like for there to be interaction based on text inputs, deciding which part of the museum you want to go to, asking for info about the work, that sort of stuff. I would also like to include pop up images to display the portfolio pieces, and possibly other things like images of the museum, or a map, instead of just opening it in a different Python tab, currently my main idea for doing this is to make them the background of a py.game function, but I'll have to see if there's a better way to do that.

# Challenges: I think the big challenge here is going to be figuring out how to allow people to go to different parts of the museum without it being a big mess of code, basically figuring out how to have it run certain defined functions based on their inputs.

# Outcomes: 

## Ideal Outcome: I think my ideal outcome is a project where everything feels very interactive and there are several different zones to go to to look at things, with images that pop up outside of just the portfolio pieces.

## Minimum Viable Outcome: I think my minimum viable outcome is three different sections people can go to to look at my portfolio pieces, with some interaction for information from the curator.

# Milestones:

## 11/11/2025-11/18/2025: This is the week I want to get all the base info in order, set up the input adaptive code structure, and make sure that the absolute basics are there.

## 11/18/2025 - 11/25/2025: This is the week that I want to make use of the adaptive text based input system and put it fully into gear, making it so that they are given options to ask for more info, making sure they can move between exhibits smoothly, that sort of stuff

## 11/25/2025 - 12/02/2025: This is the week that I want to start implementing the images into it, making sure that the code brings up the images they want to look at if they're in the right place and ask to look at the specific one, all that sort of stuff

## 12/02/2025 - 12/09/2025: This is the week for wrapping everything up, bug testing if there are bugs to be fixed, and also adding additional touches that make it a better experience if I have the time. This is also the week I record the video demonstration.
